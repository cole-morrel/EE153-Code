Repository contains code for ESP32-C3-WROOM-02 based autonomous temperature 
sensor. Code is formatted in structure of four custom importable "libraries" and
main file responsible for implementing high level program logic. Libraries 
include 'mqtt_comms,' 'store_flash,' 'temp_sensor,' and 'minimal_wifi.' These
libraries are located in the ./lib folder (as is standard for PlatformIO 
projects) with each containing a header file and source file. The main source
file for the program is located in the ./src directory and includes the 
previously mentioned libraries (in order to handle the different technical 
aspects of the program), while the main.c file is mostly responsible for 
implementing the higher level logic and state machine used to determine what 
task gets executed by the device on startup.
